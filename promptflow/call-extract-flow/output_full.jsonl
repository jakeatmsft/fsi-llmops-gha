Anyway, when I called Apple today to try to sort it out, they said that yes, they see that someone else had been using my credit card against their Apple ID, I guess.  They're providing me a refund, but they recommended that I work with you because obviously someone has my debit card information.  Okay.

I know that there's an overdraft and I had another one the other day, and I thought when I went into the ABC Bank, the main branch, that there was a, well, firstly, my husband dealt me the money so I would not be overdrawn, and there continues to be an Adobe, California charge.  When I was looking back through, like, I'm down to the T to what I'm spending for months, and so when I'm, you know, there's that charge, I don't recognize it, I didn't make that charge.  I even went on, like, the Adobe website, and I don't have, like, a login or anything, so I don't know where that's from.  So I need to dispute all those Adobe charges, and I'm almost wondering if it was someone I used to work at, this company, which I haven't worked there since, like, May, I used to be in charge of all of their, like, marketing and things like that, and so when I left, everything was switched over, so I'm wondering if they kept my credit card number on there, and didn't realize, or whatever it was, I tried to contact them, I haven't heard back from them, but I did not authorize those charges because I don't have an Adobe account.  Okay, I got you.  I do see, the most recent one I was on the 14th, it does say something about, like, it says sub, so I'm assuming it's because of a subscription, so that might be why.  Yeah, I even used to have my phone, you know, like on the iPhone, you can see what you've subscribed to, and it's not on there, so it must be through the old company that I worked with, or something like that, so you can fight with them over it, but I did not authorize those on my credit card.  Okay, not a problem.  So let me go ahead, and I'll go ahead and start that dispute for you.  Because had that not hit my account, I don't think I would have been overdrawn.

So, yeah, I was concerned about that.  Yeah, there's no other questionable charges or withdrawals, but I went back several months, so it was just kind of weird, but I can't...  I don't know what the withdrawal is from.  Alright, okay, how much are the transactions for?  There's one charge for $73.84, and then there's two recurring charges for $15.77.  Alright, thank you for that.  Alright, so one of them says audible that could have something to do with, like, some type of maybe digital service with Amazon, like whether it's like a book.  Yeah, and I figured that, but there was nothing that was purchased.  My partner and I share an account where I actually only make Amazon purchases through his account.

They said the only thing they could do is cancel whatever they had going on over there.  Whoever used my car for whatever that was, from business or something, they said they can only cancel out the business account.  Okay, okay.  So you spoke to the business department.  Okay.  Yes, the billing department.  Okay.  So are these transactions pending or have they posted on your account yet?  So the $<number_661> one is pending right now because it just took it off when I just called and found out.  And the other two probably already posted because I didn't see them until today.

So I checked my debit card and texted transactions, and I saw that there was a $13 fee for free shipping, and I don't use my debit card unless it's for like paying off my credit card, automatic payments like my car payment and stuff.  I don't like using my debit card because it's hard to like just this fraud, it's not that easy to get it off.  So I saw the charge and I think that's very weird.  I literally don't know what that is.  So I checked other charges on my account, and I saw it again in the previous month.  So it looks like this charge has been coming out of my card every month for $13.  I'm so confused what this is.  So I just asked the representative via chat if they could help me, and they basically pointed me in this direction because I wanted to dispute them.  And she said that they had been charging my account since last October or last February.  So it's been a year now that they've been charging me $13 every month.  So I looked up their phone number and she gave me their phone number, and it looks like it's a fraud charge.  Like other people have gotten this, like it's on like a fraud website, so that's very concerning.  Okay, I can take a look at it.  Okay.  Thank you.  Like it says free shipping and $13.

And can you provide me with the account number or your social security number, please?  <number_735>.  Thank you so much.  One moment.  We'll pull up your information.  Hi, Mr.  Walker.  How can I help you today?  Now is just time to check my account balance.  All right.  Can you verify me the verbal password, please?  Yup, 24.  Thank you so much.  And can you also verify me a recent transaction amount that could be a deposit withdrawal purchase?  It would be $<number_736> from the ATM.  That was like last Monday.  Thank you so much for verifying that information for me.  Right now the account is overdrawn by $<number_737>.39.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  You're very welcome.  Anything else I can assist you with today?  That's all.  All right.  Then I hope you have a good day.  Thank you."}
{"call_chunk":"Hi, thank you so much for calling ABC Bank.  My name is Ari.  Can I have your first name, please?  My first name is Corey Spomer.  Hi there, Mr.  Spomer.  How are you doing today?  I'm all right, yourself.  I'm doing well.  Thank you for asking.  How can I help you?  My kids, we were buying some Xbox stuff last night, and I just happened to look at some banking stuff.  It's not Xbox related, but there's a Spotify account that's charging my account for the third month now, and I just called it.  I didn't sign up for any Spotify.  Sure.  Have you reached out to Spotify?  I went through.  I do have the app free, and I looked through all of the payment options and stuff, and it's asking me to sign up and do all that.  Even on my account, I'm not signed up for it.  So this is a fraudulent account, or someone charging me from a different place or something.  I would recommend, firstly, to see if you can reach out to Spotify's customer service number to see if they might be able to give you the origin of it, and if they might just be able to refund the money to your account if you explain that it isn't your account linked that's being charged.  And if they're able to do that, that's usually an optimal result that we like to notify people of.  But we can file a dispute once it's cleared on the account, but disputes do take some time.  So if you're able to resolve it with Spotify to even just figure out what the origin of it could be.  No, I'm not willing to go that route.  I'll get and call my money out of this bank account if I have to.  You guys need to put an immediate stop on this, please.  Since the transaction is pending, we cannot put a stop on something that's processing.  We would have to wait until the transaction became a part of your posted transactions to dispute it.  Okay, I have had issues like this in the past.  You guys had definitely helped me out as far as getting the $30 back that they took from me and being able to stop waiting for the pending.  I had disput"}
{"call_chunk":"Thank you for coming to see us.  This is Talia.  May I have your first and last name, please?  Manda.  Hello.  Thank you.  And do you...  Oh, never mind.  How can I assist you this evening, ma'am?  I need to just do an action on my checking.  Sure, I can help you with that.  Give me a moment.  And what transaction are we looking at, ma'am?  First one for $<number_742>.88.  Oh, I see it.  It's PP...  Oh, I came in.  I don't even know what that spells.  Is that the X, the R, and D?  Is that the one?  Yeah.  Okay.  Give me one moment.  I'll get it pulled up and we'll get it processed for you.  Okay?  Yeah.  First two of them with that same...  Oh, for the same amount?  No, there's two different amounts.  Okay.  I see the one...  I'm gonna get my banking just off that, but it's not.  I'm glad you...  I see two of them, one for $59.99 and one for $<number_743>.88.  Is that correct?  Yes.  Okay, perfect.  Give me a moment.  I apologize for the delay.  Okay, that\u00eds better.  Give me the doable account.  Okay, this has to ask you a few questions to get it processed.  Can you verify your mailing address for me please?  In the city state?  In your phone number please.  Thank you.  Okay, and these transactions you wanted to dispute them because is there a problem with the transaction or you didn\u00edt authorize it?  I didn\u00edt authorize it.  Okay.  Now just a few questions.  Did you provide your debit card information to this merchant for this transaction?  I put my debit information in there and then I looked at an invoice and then the thing went blank.  So they sent me an email and I sent them an email to cancel it because I didn\u00edt authorize it and then they sent me another charge.  Okay.  Now have you ever purchased anything from this merchant?  No.  Okay.  And where was your debit card when the transaction happened?  With me.  Okay.  And do you store your debit card information on your mobile device or any other device?  Yes.  And where was that device, ma'am?  On my iPhone.  I m"}
{"call_chunk":"Thank you for choosing ABC Bank.com.  My name is Valandra.  Can you provide me with your first and last name, please?  Myra Freeman.  How you doing, Ms.  Freeman?  I'm the artist here.  I'm good.  I was calling to see you.  So a few hours ago, I had just got a new car order, and I was wondering if it was possible I can paint that car.  I can paint that car information to replace it with my old one.  What part of the information?  I do have to know that, like my new car, like my car number and stuff like that.  Because it hasn't, of course it hasn't came in a million since I just ordered it today, so I'm just trying to see if I can get the car information ready.  Okay.  We're unable to provide that car number because we can't see the security code or the expiration date.  But would it be like on my mobile banking or something?  You wouldn't be able to see it until you actually activate the card.  Oh, okay, got you.  Okay, so I was just happy to hear that.  All right, well, thank you anyway.  Yes, ma'am.  Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  No, that would be it.  Thank you.  Well, thank you for being a valuable customer P&C.  I hope you have a great rest of your day.  Thank you.

And how about the last four of your telephone number so I can send you a verification code?  Well, you have my old number, so I need to give you my new number.  My old number is <number_745>, but I've recently changed my number, so I need to give you that.  It is <number_746>.  Okay, hold on one moment.  I'm here.  No, that's okay.  Let me just get you verified another way here, and then we will get that new number put in for you.  All right.  Would you possibly be able to provide me with two recent transactions on your account?  Let me think.  Hold on.  Sure.  I know I tried to do one, I believe it was Monday, and it was declined at Junies Gas Mall.  And I can't tell you that one, because it was probably around the portion of a month.  That's the only one I can tell you about.  Okay.  Is that the reason why the problem is about that transaction on Monday?  Okay.  Would you happen to have any deposits into your account within the last two weeks, or anything like that?  No, we'll have it.  Okay.  Let's see here.  How about a debit card?  Do you have a debit card for this account?  I do.  Hold on one second.  Let me grab it.  Okay.  And I would just need the last five numbers in the expiration date.  I'm doing my wallets.  You said the last five numbers in the expiration date?  Yes, please.  Okay.  Here's <number_747>.  And expiration date is <number_748>.  Fantastic.  Thank you so much.  All right.  And so you were calling about a decline transaction, getting information on that?  Yes.  I couldn't figure out.  I've done it Monday at Jimmy's Gas Mart, and it was declined.  And I knew I had a little bit of money in the bank.  And when I got home, I got to look at things.  My bank was linked with my cash app account.  And I've seen where $15 was cash out of my account to a Tony Riddler at <number_749> on Monday.  And I did not "}

I'm going to cut one on hold here, and I'm doing a dispute form, and he's closing down the card to his checking account.  He has two cards.  Okay?  How can I tell which card is going to be closed on the account, or will they both be closed?  It will depend on the one that's attached to the charge that you're disputing, so what's the charge that you're disputing?  It's a $25.99 charge, $95.00 charge to, I don't want to back out of this.  I'll search it by the amount of tests to correct the welcome issue.  Let me just open it.  $25.99 to ACFD.  That's it.  ACDF, Bill.  Okay.  From last year?  No, it's from September 15 of this year.  September 15 of this year?  Oh, $29.95.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I know what I said.  You're good.  So if you, that one is only going to close the card that ends in $8.70.  I just clicked on the, I went into transaction history, and then if you click on the charge itself, it'll say card number in the last four, it'll only close down that card.  So it's carried.  Okay, because he's got two more here, so he doesn't want, he travels out in California and he's going to be able to get to the top of the list.  So that's $8.70.  So that's $8.70.  So that's $8.70.  So that's $8.70.  So that's $8.70.  So that's $8.70.  So that's $8.70.  So it's carried.  Okay.  Because he's got two more here, so he doesn't want, he travels out in California right now.  Yeah.  So the $8.70.  $7.33 card is going to always be the one that closed.  You can always just double check it while you're still in the dispute because the dispute is going to fall under service browser and that tab on the right, because you have a list of tabs to go through.
