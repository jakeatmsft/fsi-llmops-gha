Thank you.  You're welcome.  How can I help you?  Well, unfortunately, I think my debit card has been compromised.  I started about a week ago receiving some that looked like normal charges from Apple.  It would be associated with my Apple ID.  Then over the last week there's been about 10 charges, all small, about $9.99.  Anyway, when I called Apple today to try to sort it out, they said that yes, they see that someone else had been using my credit card against their Apple ID, I guess.  They're providing me a refund, but they recommended that I work with you because obviously someone has my debit card information.  Okay.  Can I please have your account number, Social Security number?  Yes.  Social is <number_185>.  Thank you so much.  All right, Mr.  Gowen.

Let me go back and verify the account with the Apple stuff.  So this was, you said, it started in August.  It's small, big, small, and August the 16th, the $49.99.  Sorry, I hear that.  So I want to add an account.  Oh, and I see it.  All right.  Let me open this up.  And the system, we can get started here.  So you didn't make any of these transactions.  No.  I have an Apple credit card, and I pay the payment.  But, and the key, that's money.  I mean, I didn't know what I was expecting.  And it's all $99.99, $39.99.  I mean, I may have spent $2.98 to get an Apple in my phone or something.  So just add in there, about $<number_220>.  And $34.  I see it on this one, but why not on this one?  It goes all the way to the 18th.  Oh, yeah, I see it.  I can have to help you dispute these.  You said the only one you might have done was the most $29.99.  I do still not give you just what I...

I had a chance last night to look over some of my statements.  And both of my checking accounts, both of my cards have been used for quite a few charges that are not mine.  And I was only able to see on my card, I mean on my phone, charges as far back as like the end of July.  Or the end, yeah.  So, I don't even know how many more charges there are from before that time.  You can dispute a charge up to <number_242> days previously.  I can look them up for you.  Okay.  You're only going to scroll back like 60 or 90 days on your online bank.  But yeah, I can go back <number_243> days.  Sure.  Yeah, sorry this happened to you.  If someone's charging your card without you knowing it, let's take a look at it to dispute those charges for you.  Can you give me your account number, your social security number to begin with?  Yes.  <number_244>.  Okay, thanks.  Let me just get that pulled up and get you verified here.  We'll get you helped out today.  So, to verify you, I'd like to send a one-time passcode to your cell phone, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Before I send it, can you tell me the last four numbers of your cell phone please?  Yes.  <number_245>.  I'll send it right over there.  It'll be in the text if you can please pull it up and read it off to me.  Mm-hmm.  Thanks.  <number_246>.  Thank you.  Let me just take a minute to get your information up on my screen.  So, you say you have two checking accounts?  I actually, I've got three accounts.  I think the first two are checking and the third is a saving, but all of the charges were only on the first two.  Right, right.  Okay.  So, which account do you want to start out with first?  Let's start out with the account "}

I think you find out exactly what this commanding presence charge is coming out of my check-in.  I had a problem with my phone banking and I had to uninstall the program because it's still my password.  And I reinstalled the program and now I'm seeing charges coming up that I don't know what they are.  Okay, all right.  Let's take a look at here.  So we're going to look at this transaction history here.  Thank you.  No problem.  Let's see what I see.  There's three from something called commanding PR.  Let's see.  One is on <number_315>, the other is on <number_316>, and the next one is <number_317>.  Commanding PR.  You know what, let me see.  <number_318>.  Each time.  Let's see.  Okay.  Search that.  Yep, <number_319> and then <number_320> and <number_320>9.  So I'm going to take a look and see.  That looks like a subscription type thing.  Let me see.  Let me see what I see.  Okay, can you see?  I'm going to be able to see what it tells me.  That's right, John, but I didn't get anything.  I don't have, I can't forward a $50 subscription to anything.  Right.  No, I totally deserve it.  Yeah, I totally get that.  So, yeah, that all just brings to Linux stuff to me.  That doesn't make any sense for you.  Yeah.  Okay, so with these, we can distribute these transactions, obviously.  Now, to distribute these, it's probably going to want to close your deaf card.  Are you okay with that?  I'm just trying to be able to see.  You're breaking up.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, no.  Are you there?  No, yeah.  Hold on.  I was just reconnecting my phone to my phone cord.  My phone cord is kind of being weird this week.  So, are you okay?  It's doing it again.  How about now?  That's better.  And there's two other charges down there that are, I don't have a clue.  One of them is realistic functional for $9.99 on $7.29.  And then the other one is called $7.29 for th"}
